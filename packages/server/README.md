# @varasto/server

HTTP interface implementation to Varasto key-value store. Can be run standalone
or embedded to other [Express.js] applications.

[express.js]: https://expressjs.com

## Installation

If you want to run the server as standalone:

```sh
$ npm install @varasto/server
```

Or if you want to use the server in your own Express.js application:

```sh
$ npm install --save @varasto/server
```

## Usage

As mentioned previously, the package can be used as part of an Express.js
application or as an standalone application.

### Standalone

```sh
$ varasto [-p port] [-a username:password] <directory>
```

Port which the HTTP server will be responding from can be specified with the
`-p` flag. By default Varasto will use port `3000`.

Optional [basic access authentication] can be enabled with `-a` flag.

The directory where items are stored is specified with `<directory>` command
line argument. If the directory does not exist, it will be created once items
are being stored.

Once the HTTP server is up and running, you can use HTTP methods `GET`, `POST`
and `DELETE` to retrieve, store and remove items from the store.

#### Security notes

The server does not currently support [HTTPS] and the only authentication
(which is not enabled by default) is [basic access authentication] so you
might not want to expose it to public network.

### Embedded

The package provides an function called `createServer`, which returns an
Express.js application.

Basic usage looks like this:

```TypeScript
import { createServer } from '@varasto/server';
import { createFileSystemStorage } from '@varasto/fs-storage';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const storage = createFileSystemStorage({ dir: './data' });

app.use('/', createServer(storage));
```

#### Authentication

To enable [basic access authentication] for the API, an optional configuration
can be given to the `createServer` function.

```TypeScript
app.use('/', createServer(storage, {
  auth: {
    username: 'AzureDiamond',
    password: 'hunter2'
  }
}));
```

### Storing items

To store an item, you can use a `POST` request like this:

```http
POST /foo/bar HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 14

{"foo": "bar"}
```

Or you can use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) to store an item like this:

```bash
$ curl -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"foo": "bar"}' \
    http://localhost:3000/foo/bar
```

Namespace of the item in the example above would be `foo` and the key would be
`bar`. These identifiers can now be used to retrieve, update or remove the
stored item.

### Retrieving items

To retrieve a previously stored item, you make an `GET` request, where the
request path again acts as the identifier of the item.

```http
GET /foo/bar HTTP/1.0
```

To which the HTTP server will respond with the JSON object previously stored
with namespace `foo` and key `bar`. If an item with given key under the given
namespace does not exist, HTTP error 404 will be returned instead.

### Listing items

To list all items stored under an namespace, you make an `GET` request with
name of the namespace as the request path.

```http
GET /foo HTTP/1.0
```

To which the HTTP server will respond with an JSON object which contains
each item stored under namespace `foo` mapped with the key that they were
stored with.

### Removing items

To remove an previously stored item, you make a `DELETE` request, with the
request path again acting as the identifier of the item you wish to remove.

```http
DELETE /foo/bar HTTP/1.0
```

If item with key `bar` under namespace `foo` exists, it's value will be
returned as response. If such item does not exist, HTTP error 404 will be
returned instead.

### Updating items

You can also partially update an already existing item with `PATCH` request.
The JSON sent with an `PATCH` request will be shallowly merged with the already
existing data and the result will be sent as response.

For example, you have an item `john-doe` under namespace `people` with the
following data:

```JSON
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "address": "Some street 4",
    "phoneNumber": "+35840123123"
}
```

And you send an `PATCH` request like this:

```http
PATCH /people/john-doe HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 71

{
    "address": "Some other street 5",
    "faxNumber": "+358000000"
}
```

You end up with:

```JSON
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "address": "Some other street 5",
    "phoneNumber": "+35840123123",
    "faxNumber": "+358000000"
}
```
